# TwitterWhoUnfollowedYou

A first, simple solution to find out who unfollowed you on twitter.
First, run

`python init.py`

to save your list of friends, and then, later the day or whenever you want to
know who unfollowed you until then, run

`python find_unfollowers.py`

Future improvements are to run the script every hour, to have a clearer dataset, since a lot can happen during a day.
